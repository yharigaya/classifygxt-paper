# `performance`

This directory contains a Snakemake workflow for evaluating
computational performance. The code under this directory takes as input the output from the workflows under the [sim](https://github.com/yharigaya/classifygxt-paper/tree/main/sim), [wntrna](https://github.com/yharigaya/classifygxt-paper/tree/main/wntrna), and [wntatac](https://github.com/yharigaya/classifygxt-paper/tree/main/wntatac) directories.
